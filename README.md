Goal
The goal of this project is to create an accurate and reliable localization system that uses visual information from the environment, 
rather than GPS, to determine a user’s position. This system is designed to work in various scenarios, such as indoor environments,
poorly lit areas, or places where GPS signals are weak, 
like underground or urban canyons.

Solution Approach
This solution uses several machine learning techniques to process images, extract relevant features, and identify locations through unsupervised clustering. The workflow consists of the following steps:

Image Collection and Preprocessing:
The system starts by reading images from cameras, which may be taken in low-light conditions (such as at night). 
These images contain features of the surrounding environment, which will be used for localization.

Feature Extraction Using CNN: 
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is employed to extract features from the images. 
The CNN is trained to identify important visual patterns from the environment (such as buildings, roads, or unique landmarks). 
These features represent the key information needed for accurate localization.

Dimensionality Reduction Using Autoencoder: 
To reduce the complexity and size of the extracted features, an autoencoder is applied. 
The autoencoder compresses the high-dimensional image features into a smaller latent space. 
This compression helps capture only the most important aspects of the environment while discarding irrelevant details.

Clustering Using Self-Organizing Maps (SOM): 
Once the feature vectors are compressed by the autoencoder, a Self-Organizing Map (SOM) is used for clustering. 
SOM is an unsupervised learning algorithm that organizes the data into a 2D grid based on the similarity of features. 
This clustering step groups similar environments together, allowing the system to identify which area the user is likely in based on the features of the captured images.

Localization: 
The system then matches the clustered features of the image with a predefined map (or database of locations) to estimate the user’s location. 
The clustering results help match the captured image with the most likely geographic area or location in the map.

Web Application for Visualization: Finally, the localization results are integrated into a web application.
The application receives the clustered location from the system and visualizes it on a map interface, showing the user’s estimated position. 
The user can upload new images to the system, which will return the most probable location based on the image features and clustering results.

Technologies Used

Python for developing the entire project pipeline.
OpenCV for image processing and manipulation.
TensorFlow for CNN and autoencoder model development.
MiniSom  for implementing the Self-Organizing Map.
Flask for creating the web application.
HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the front-end visualization of the location.

Workflow Summary
Image Input: Capture images using a camera (can be a smartphone or other camera device).
Feature Extraction: Use a CNN to extract features from the images.
Autoencoder Compression: Reduce feature dimensionality using an autoencoder.
Clustering: Apply SOM to cluster the images based on similarity.
Localization: Estimate the location by comparing clustered features with a location database.
Web Application: Display the estimated location in a user-friendly map interface.

Impact
Reliability: 
Provides an alternative to GPS-based location tracking, especially in scenarios where GPS signals are weak or unavailable.
Versatility: 
Works in both indoor and outdoor environments with varying lighting conditions, including low-light environments.
Cost-Effective: 
Does not require expensive GPS hardware, leveraging easily accessible camera devices instead.
Scalability: 
Can be used in large-scale environments like smart cities, shopping malls, or underground transit systems where GPS is unreliable.
Real-Time Application: 
The system can be deployed in real-time applications, providing instant localization based on live camera feeds.
Future Enhancements
Integration with other sensors: 
Combining visual data with other sensor data (such as accelerometers or gyroscopes) could further enhance accuracy.
Improved Accuracy: 
Fine-tuning the model with a larger dataset could improve localization accuracy, especially in challenging environments.
Real-time Updates: 
Enhance the web application to update the user’s location in real-time as they move.
